**Objective:**
To practice and understand how to create SQL views that abstract and simplify complex queries.

**What Was Done:**

* Created 5 different views using the `CREATE VIEW` statement.
* Combined data across multiple related tables using `JOIN`.
* Implemented logic like aggregation (`SUM`) and filtering (salary > 70000).
* Used views for:

  * Displaying combined employee and branch details.
  * Summarizing sales per employee.
  * Linking clients with their respective branches.
  * Filtering high-earning employees.
  * Displaying branch-supplier relationships with details.

**Why Views Are Useful:**

* Abstract complex logic.
* Reuse queries for reporting or security.
* Simplify access to frequently used data structures.
